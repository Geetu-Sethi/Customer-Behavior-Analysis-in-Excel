# Customer Behavior Analysis in Excel

In this project, I am going to perform Customer Behavior Analysis on the Bikes Buyers dataset.

From now onwards, I will walk you through my project. So, let's begin the journey!! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ


## âœ¨Project's Objective
This project aims to help the business in gaining the insights related to various factors that can influence whether someone purchased a bike or not, and also to help them in making data driven decisions. 
## ðŸ“ŒData Cleaning & Processing
Before performing the Analysis on the data based on the Research Questions. I would make my hands dirty by cleaning it!!ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜Ž

I performed the following steps in cleaning & processing:-

1. Duplicates Removal and trimming the extra spaces.


2. Created Categorical Columns by using "Nested IF Function" on Age and Income numerical columns.

3. Short Forms of Marital Status column's data values changed to Full Forms for better understandability. 


ðŸ“ŒðŸ“Œ I could also remove columns such as ID, Children, Education and Cars because these columns are not that useful for my analysis. But, I kept them as the dataset is not that big.  

Now, it's time to wake up your sleeping detective as we are diving into the Analysis World!! ðŸ¤ ðŸ˜€

Are you ready? Then let's dive in!! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š





## ðŸ¤”Research Questions

These are the questions on the basis of which I performed the analysis:  
1. Which Gender purchased the more number of bikes?

2. Which Income group customers purchased the highest and lowest number of bikes?

3. Which Regions are having the highest and lowest bikes purchase?

4. Which Age groups purchased the highest and lowest number of bikes?

5. Whether Home Owners bought the bikes or not?

6. Which factors are contributing in decision making of whether to purchase a bike or not?

7. Find the no. of bikes purchased per Commute Distance. Is there any visible trend?
## âœ¨Findings based on Analysis
ðŸ“ŒBelow are my Findings based on Analysis: 

1. Male purchased the more number of bikes as compared to females.

2. Income group which purchased the highest no. of bikes- $10000-$50000  

Income group which purchased the lowest no. of bikes- More than $100000 

3. Regions which purchased the highest and lowest no. of bikes are North America and Pacific respectively.

4. Age group which purchased the highest no. of bikes is-Middle Age

Age group which purchased the lowest no. of bikes is- Young Adult

5. People who own house purchased more no. of bikes in comparison to those who don't have any house.

6. Factors which influencing the buying behaviour of customers are:
(i) Gender, as Males purchased more bikes in comparison to females.

(ii) Income, as people who are falling in low income ($10000-$50000) group purchased more bikes in comparison to high income (More than $100000) group people.

(iii) Age, as Young Adults and Old age people bought lesser bikes in comparison to Middle Age.

(iv) Whether a person owns a house or not, as people who own a house purchased more no. of bikes in comparison to those who don't have any house.

7. People whose Commute distance in the range of 0-1 Miles purchased highest no. of bikes as compared to people whose Commute distance is More than 10 Miles. 

But, there is no relation between Commute distance and no. of bikes purchased, as for Commute distances between 5-10 Miles and 1-2 Miles, the trend is somewhat distorted. 

 








 


## ðŸ“ŒSuggestions

Below are the suggestions based on my analysis:

â€¢ We should find the reason behind the Low purchases of bikes in Pacific region by conducting Customer Surveys and monitoring Market.

â€¢ We should provide discounts to Young Adults and People who don't have any house as they fall under low income group and have more financial liabilities.

â€¢ We should gather more data and refine our data collection process in order to understand why Commute distance column is showing weird trend.
