# Customer Behavior Analysis – Bike Buyers Dataset


## Objective
This project aims to analyze customer behavior patterns to identify key factors influencing bike purchases. The insights derived will help businesses make data-driven decisions to improve targeting and marketing strategies.


## Data Cleaning & Preparation
Before conducting the analysis, the dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and consistency:

• Removed Duplicates and trimmed extra spaces to maintain data integrity.

• Created Categorical Variables for Age and Income groups using logical conditions.

• Standardized Data Labels by converting short-form marital status values to full-form for better readability.

• Evaluated Column Relevance: Considered dropping ID, Children, Education, and Cars columns due to low analytical value, but retained them as the dataset size was small.


## Key Research Questions & Analysis
The analysis was structured around the following key questions:

1. Which gender group has the highest bike purchase rate?
2. Which income group contributes most and least to bike purchases?
3. Which regions exhibit the highest and lowest bike sales?
4. How does age influence bike purchasing behavior?
5. Do homeownership and bike purchases correlate?
6. What key factors influence customer decisions to purchase a bike?
7. How does commute distance impact bike purchases?

## Findings & Insights

1. Gender: Male customers purchased more bikes than female customers.

2. Income Groups:

    • Highest purchases: Customers with an annual income between $10,000-$50,000.

    • Lowest purchases: Customers earning above $100,000.

3. Regional Trends:

   • North America had the highest number of bike purchases.

   • Pacific had the lowest.

4. Age Groups:

   • Middle-aged customers had the highest purchase rate.

   • Young adults had the lowest.

5. Homeownership Impact: Homeowners were more likely to purchase bikes compared to renters.

## Key Influencing Factors:

• Gender – Male customers showed higher purchase rates.

• Income Level – Low to mid-income groups were more likely to buy.

• Age – Middle-aged customers were the primary buyers.

• Homeownership – Homeowners were more inclined to purchase.

• Commute Distance & Purchase Behavior:

• Customers with a commute distance of 0-1 miles had the highest bike purchase rate.

• No strong correlation was observed between increasing commute distance and bike purchases, except for some inconsistencies in the 1-2 mile and 5-10 mile segments. 


## Business Recommendations

• Regional Strategy: 
Conduct targeted customer surveys in the Pacific region to understand low purchase rates and identify potential market opportunities.

• Targeted Promotions:
Offer discounts or financing options to young adults and renters, as they belong to lower-income groups with higher financial constraints.

• Data Collection & Refinement:
Gather more granular data on commute distances to identify clearer trends and optimize marketing strategies.
